LuaSTG Sub Canvas feature branch
    This is a feature branch related to engine behavior change,
    which is still in early develop.
    Differences from LuaSTG Plus/LuaSTG Ex Plus:
        1. Support for more present modes and automatically select the one
           with the best performance and lowest latency.
        2. The window can be freely adjusted in size, maximized,
           and snapped to a layout.
        3. Toggle full screen mode via Alt+Enter shortcut
           (instead of Ctrl+Enter shortcut).
        4. Introduce the concept of the canvas,
           allowing fixed rendering resolutions.
        5. The canvas will automatically be letter boxing renderering
           to the window or monitor.
        6. Mouse positions are mapped to canvas coordinates.
